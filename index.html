                        <p>At the end of my degree I had the privilege to be part of the organising team for the 2020 Communication Design finalists show — A Collision between a Stream of Light and an Obstacle. The graduate show is the culmination of the work developed by the new graduates and aims to make known the projects developed in the last year of the degree. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it had to assume a fully digital format. The organising team was responsible for the development of the identity of the show, creation of the website, communication objects, social media management and a publication.</p>

                        <h4>Speculative Design — 2020</h4>
                        <p>CHRONOPOLIS is a speculative design project, which creates a city dominated by a machine where the day has 36 hours and each citizen is assigned a schedule that they are obliged to keep without question. Based on the principles of creation of Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) , we explore a new vision of temporality as well as technological advances, artificial intelligence and their role in society, authority and politics in contemporary times. In this city there is no time waste. Everything is harmoniously coordinated so that life is calm and serene, and so that there is no room for setbacks or overlaps. The time for error has become null so that nothing would disturb the well being of all citizens. The city of time opens doors to all individuals who wish to have more time for themselves, for their leisure and for their rest. Do you submit yourself?</p>

                        <h4>Typography — 2019</h4>
                        <p>A colection of 5 posters that want to portrait 5 existencial everyday problems that we all at some point in our lives though about. Only using B&W, and Times New Roman size 14pt, these posters address: the impossibility of reading all the books that exist; the impossibility of seeing all the places in the world; the insignificance of individual decisions compared to the immensity of the universe; the balance between social expectations and personal desires (like having time to see the stars); and the absurdity of existence itself.</p>
